## Outsights PHP Framework

Outsights is a stunningly fast PHP nano-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant, and intuitive syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Outsights attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tough tasks used in web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, HTTP library, configuration, storage, templating, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Outsights project website](https://libre.dorkodu.com/outsights).
