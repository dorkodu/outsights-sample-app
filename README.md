> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Outsights framework. If you want to develop an application using Outsights; download the sample app, and read the documentation : [Outsights Documentation](https://libre.dorkodu.com/outsights).

## Outsights PHP Framework

Outsights is a stunningly fast PHP pico-framework for building web applications with expressive, cool, and intuitive syntax. \
We believe development can be more enjoyable, creative experience if you can write more clear and lucid code. \
Outsights wants to achieve this by easing common hard tasks in web apps; such as routing, databases, HTTP, configuration, storage, templating, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Outsights project website](https://libre.dorkodu.com/outsights).
